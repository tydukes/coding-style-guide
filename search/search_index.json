Code","text":"<pre><code>I need to integrate the coding style guide validator into this repository. The validator is\navailable as a containerized tool that can be used via GitHub Actions, locally with Docker,\nor through a Makefile.\n\nPlease implement the following:\n\n## 1. GitHub Actions Integration (Recommended)\n\nCreate \\`.github/workflows/validate-coding-standards.yml\\` with:\n\n\\`\\`\\`yaml\nname: Validate Coding Standards\n\n\"on\":\n  push:\n    branches: [main, develop]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [main]\n\njobs:\n  validate:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Validate coding standards\n        uses: tydukes/coding-style-guide/.github/actions/validate@v1.0.0\n        with:\n          mode: validate\n          path: .\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## 2. Local Development Support\n\n### Option A: Create a Makefile\n\nAdd these targets to the repository \\`Makefile\\` (or create one):\n\n\\`\\`\\`makefile\n# Coding style validation targets\n.PHONY: validate lint format validate-docs\n\nIMAGE ?= ghcr.io/tydukes/coding-style-guide:v1.0.0\n\nvalidate: ## Run full coding standards validation\n @docker run --rm -v $$(pwd):/workspace $(IMAGE) validate\n\nlint: ## Run linters only\n @docker run --rm -v $$(pwd):/workspace $(IMAGE) lint\n\nformat: ## Auto-format code\n @docker run --rm -v $$(pwd):/workspace $(IMAGE) format\n\nvalidate-docs: ## Validate documentation (if mkdocs.yml exists)\n @docker run --rm -v $$(pwd):/workspace $(IMAGE) docs\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### Option B: Create a Shell Script\n\nCreate \\`scripts/validate.sh\\`:\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n# Validate coding standards using containerized validator\n\nset -euo pipefail\n\nIMAGE=\"${VALIDATOR_IMAGE:-ghcr.io/tydukes/coding-style-guide:v1.0.0}\"\nCOMMAND=\"${1:-validate}\"\n\ndocker run --rm -v \"$(pwd):/workspace\" \"${IMAGE}\" \"${COMMAND}\"\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nMake it executable: \\`chmod +x scripts/validate.sh\\`\n\n## 3. Pre-commit Hook (Optional)\n\nIf the repository uses pre-commit, add to \\`.pre-commit-config.yaml\\`:\n\n\\`\\`\\`yaml\nrepos:\n  - repo: local\n    hooks:\n      - id: coding-style-validator\n        name: Validate Coding Standards\n        entry: docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace ghcr.io/tydukes/coding-style-guide:v1.0.0\n        args: [lint]\n        language: system\n        pass_filenames: false\n        always_run: true\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## 4. Documentation\n\nUpdate the repository README.md with a \"Code Quality\" section:\n\n\\`\\`\\`markdown\n## Code Quality\n\nThis repository uses the [Coding Style Guide](https://github.com/tydukes/coding-style-guide)\nvalidator to ensure consistent code quality.\n\n### Running Validation Locally\n\nUsing Docker:\n\\`\\`\\`bash\ndocker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace ghcr.io/tydukes/coding-style-guide:v1.0.0 validate\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nUsing Makefile:\n\\`\\`\\`bash\nmake validate  # Full validation\nmake lint      # Linters only\nmake format    # Auto-format\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nUsing shell script:\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n./scripts/validate.sh validate\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### Available Commands\n\n- \\`validate\\` - Run all checks (linting, docs, metadata)\n- \\`lint\\` - Run linters only\n- \\`format\\` - Auto-format code\n- \\`docs\\` - Validate documentation (if mkdocs.yml present)\n- \\`metadata\\` - Check @module metadata tags\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## 5. GitLab CI (If Applicable)\n\nIf this is a GitLab repository, create/update \\`.gitlab-ci.yml\\`:\n\n\\`\\`\\`yaml\nstages:\n  - validate\n\nvalidate-coding-standards:\n  stage: validate\n  image: docker:latest\n  services:\n    - docker:dind\n  script:\n    - docker run --rm -v $CI_PROJECT_DIR:/workspace\n        ghcr.io/tydukes/coding-style-guide:v1.0.0 validate\n  only:\n    - merge_requests\n    - main\n    - develop\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Ensure Docker is available for local development\n- For GitHub Actions, no additional setup needed\n- For GitLab CI, Docker-in-Docker (dind) service required\n\n## Implementation Instructions\n\n1. Create the GitHub Actions workflow file\n2. Choose ONE of the local development options (Makefile OR shell script)\n3. Update the README with code quality section\n4. (Optional) Add pre-commit hook if the repo uses pre-commit\n5. Test locally: \\`make validate\\` or \\`./scripts/validate.sh\\`\n6. Commit and push to trigger CI validation\n\nPlease implement all applicable options based on the repository structure and platform.\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n---\n\n## Alternative: Minimal Integration Prompt\n\nIf you only want GitHub Actions integration:\n\n```markdown\nAdd coding style validation to this repository using the containerized validator.\n\nCreate \\`.github/workflows/validate-coding-standards.yml\\`:\n\n\\`\\`\\`yaml\nname: Validate Coding Standards\n\n\"on\":\n  push:\n    branches: [main, develop]\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  validate:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      - uses: tydukes/coding-style-guide/.github/actions/validate@v1.0.0\n        with:\n          mode: validate\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nAdd a Makefile with validation targets:\n\n\\`\\`\\`makefile\n.PHONY: validate lint format\n\nIMAGE ?= ghcr.io/tydukes/coding-style-guide:v1.0.0\n\nvalidate:\n @docker run --rm -v $$(pwd):/workspace $(IMAGE) validate\n\nlint:\n @docker run --rm -v $$(pwd):/workspace $(IMAGE) lint\n\nformat:\n @docker run --rm -v $$(pwd):/workspace $(IMAGE) format\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nUpdate README.md to document the validation process.\n\nTest locally with: \\`make validate\\`\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n---\n\n## Platform-Specific Prompts\n\n### For GitHub Repositories\n\n```markdown\nIntegrate the coding style guide validator into this GitHub repository:\n\n1. Add GitHub Actions workflow at \\`.github/workflows/validate-coding-standards.yml\\`\n   - Use the reusable action: \\`tydukes/coding-style-guide/.github/actions/validate@v1.0.0\\`\n   - Trigger on push to main/develop and all pull requests\n   - Use validation mode: \\`validate\\`\n\n2. Add Makefile targets for local validation:\n   - \\`make validate\\` - full validation\n   - \\`make lint\\` - linters only\n   - \\`make format\\` - auto-format code\n\n3. Update README.md with instructions on running validation locally\n\n4. Ensure the workflow is configured to run as a required status check (mention this in PR)\n\nUse container: \\`ghcr.io/tydukes/coding-style-guide:v1.0.0\\`\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### For GitLab Repositories\n\n```markdown\nIntegrate the coding style guide validator into this GitLab repository:\n\n1. Add validation job to \\`.gitlab-ci.yml\\`:\n   - Stage: validate\n   - Use Docker-in-Docker\n   - Run: \\`docker run --rm -v $CI_PROJECT_DIR:/workspace ghcr.io/tydukes/coding-style-guide:v1.0.0 validate\\`\n   - Trigger on: merge_requests, main, develop\n\n2. Create local validation script at \\`scripts/validate.sh\\`\n   - Make it executable\n   - Use container: \\`ghcr.io/tydukes/coding-style-guide:v1.0.0\\`\n\n3. Update README.md with validation instructions\n\n4.

Create \\`Makefile\\` with these targets:\n   - validate, lint, format, validate-docs\n   - Use container: \\`ghcr.io/tydukes/coding-style-guide:v1.0.0\\`\n\n2. Create \\`scripts/validate.sh\\` wrapper script\n   - Accept command as first argument (validate, lint, format)\n   - Use docker volume mount to current directory\n\n3. Add pre-commit hook configuration (if .pre-commit-config.yaml exists)\n\n4. Create \\`CONTRIBUTING.md\\` with instructions:\n   - How to run validation before committing\n   - Available validation commands\n   - How to auto-format code\n\n5. Update main README.md with \"Code Quality\" section\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n---\n\n## Customization Options\n\nYou can customize the integration by modifying the prompt:\n\n### Different Validation Modes\n\nReplace \\`mode: validate\\` with:\n\n- \\`mode: lint\\` - Only run linters (faster, no docs build)\n- \\`mode: format\\` - Auto-format code\n- \\`mode: docs\\` - Only validate documentation\n- \\`mode: metadata\\` - Only check metadata tags\n\n### Specific Container Version\n\nReplace \\`v1.0.0\\` with:\n\n- \\`latest\\` - Always use latest version (may break)\n- \\`v1.0.0\\` - Pin to specific version (recommended)\n- \\`main\\` - Use latest main branch build\n\n### Additional Configuration\n\nAdd to the GitHub Action:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: tydukes/coding-style-guide/.github/actions/validate@v1.0.0\n  with:\n    mode: validate\n    path: .\n    strict: true              # Fail on warnings\n    continue-on-error: false  # Don't continue if validation fails\n</code></pre>","tags":["integration","ai","claude","workflow","automation"]},{"location":"07_integration/integration_prompt/#complete-example-integration","title":"Complete Example Integration","text":"<p>Here's a complete prompt for full integration:</p> <p>```markdown Integrate the tydukes/coding-style-guide validator into this repository with the following:</p>","tags":["integration","ai","claude","workflow","automation"]},{"location":"07_integration/integration_prompt/#github-actions","title":"GitHub Actions","text":"<p>Create `.github/workflows/validate-coding-standards.yml` that: - Triggers on push to main/develop and all PRs - Uses the reusable action: `tydukes/coding-style-guide/.github/actions/validate@v1.0.0` - Runs in validation mode - Should be a required check for PRs</p>","tags":["integration","ai","claude","workflow","automation"]},{"location":"07_integration/integration_prompt/#local-development","title":"Local Development","text":"<p>Add a `Makefile` with these targets: - `make validate` - Full validation - `make lint` - Linters only - `make format` - Auto-format code - `make help` - Show available targets</p> <p>All targets should use: `ghcr.io/tydukes/coding-style-guide:v1.0.0`</p>","tags":["integration","ai","claude","workflow","automation"]},{"location":"07_integration/integration_prompt/#documentation","title":"Documentation","text":"<p>Update `README.md` with a new \"Code Quality\" section that explains: - How to run validation locally - Available make commands - Link to the coding style guide documentation: https://tydukes.github.io/coding-style-guide/</p>","tags":["integration","ai","claude","workflow","automation"]},{"location":"07_integration/integration_prompt/#optional-enhancements","title":"Optional Enhancements","text":"<p>If this repo has: - `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Add validator hook - `.gitlab-ci.yml` - Add validation job - `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Add validation instructions</p> <p>Container: `ghcr.io/tydukes/coding-style-guide:v1.0.0` Documentation: https://tydukes.github.io/coding-style-guide/</p> <p>Please implement all applicable options based on the repository structure. ```</p>","tags":["integration","ai","claude","workflow","automation"]},{"location":"07_integration/integration_prompt/#quick-reference","title":"Quick Reference","text":"<p>Container Image: <code>ghcr.io/tydukes/coding-style-guide:v1.0.0</code></p> <p>GitHub Action: <code>tydukes/coding-style-guide/.github/actions/validate@v1.0.0</code></p> <p>Documentation: https://tydukes.github.io/coding-style-guide/</p> <p>Commands: <code>validate</code>, <code>lint</code>, <code>format</code>, <code>docs</code>, <code>metadata</code></p> <p>Repository: https://github.com/tydukes/coding-style-guide</p>","tags":["integration","ai","claude","workflow","automation"]}]}
