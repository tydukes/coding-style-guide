- Strict, automatable formatting across repo with pre-commit and CI enforcement.
- AI-friendly metadata (inline comment tags) for modules and scripts.
- Monorepo / multi-repo flexibility: language-specific guides are standalone and referenced.
- Semantic versioning for the guides and changelog-driven releases.
