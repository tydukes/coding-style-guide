            The automated dependency version check has detected outdated dependencies in the main branch.

            ## Details

            - **Workflow Run**: ${context.payload.repository.html_url}/actions/runs/${context.runId}
            - **Triggered**: ${new Date().toISOString()}
            - **Branch**: ${context.ref}

            ## Action Required

            Review the failed workflow run to identify which dependencies are outdated and update them accordingly.

            ## Jobs Status

            Check the workflow run link above to see which specific dependency checks failed:
            - Python packages
            - GitHub Actions
            - Docker images
            - Pre-commit hooks
